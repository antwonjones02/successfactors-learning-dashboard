creditHours                  Credit hours are the number of hours           Edm.Double
                             that a user earns for completing a learn-
                             ing event. For example, in many U.S. col-
                             leges, students attend a single class for
                             15 weeks, 3 days each week, and 1 hour
                             each day. In this case, the total hours
                             equal 45; however, the college grants
                             3 CREDIT HOURS for this class. The
                             hours can be inherited from the learning
                             event (the course) or they can be speci-
                             fied when a user, manager, or administra-
                             tor records completion with the Record

cpeHours                     CPE is an abbreviation for "Continuing         Edm.Double
                             Professional Education" and refers to
                             learning activities that users perform to
                             maintain and expand the skills that their
                             profession demands. Therefore, CPE
                             hours are very much like credit hours,
                             but the accumulation of CPE hours often
                             leads to a professional certification. The
                             hours can be inherited from the learning
                             event (the course) or they can be speci-
                             fied when a user, manager, or administra-
                             tor records completion with the Record
                             Learning wizard.

defaultInitialNumber         The initial number is the number of days,      Edm.Int64
                             weeks, months, quarters, or years that
                             the user has in their initial retraining pe-
                             riod for this learning item. Retraining pe-
                             riods apply when the learning item is a
                             member of a curriculum. It is the grace
                             period when users are first assigned a
                             learning item. Although they might be
                             required to retrain on the learning item
                             every year, they might be assigned the
                             curriculum (and learning item) in the last
                             month of the year. The initial period gives
                             them a grace period to complete the first
                             training.
