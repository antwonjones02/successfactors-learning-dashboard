# SAP SuccessFactors Learning API Requirements Analysis

## API Documentation Overview
Based on the comprehensive analysis of the SAP SuccessFactors Learning OData APIs documentation, the following key components have been identified for integration into our learning data dashboard application.

## Authentication
- **OAuth Authentication**: SAP SuccessFactors Learning uses OAuth for API authentication
- **Token Acquisition Process**:
  1. Concatenate client ID and secret with a colon separator
  2. Encode the concatenated string with base64 encoding
  3. Call the token granting service over HTTPS
  4. Pass the encoded credentials in the request header
  5. Store the returned token for subsequent API calls
- **Token Management**: Tokens have expiration times and must be refreshed accordingly
- **Note**: SAP recommends using the platform token server rather than the SuccessFactors Learning token server for improved security

## Key Endpoints for Learning Completion Data

### Learning History and Completion
- `/user/learningHistory/v1`: Retrieves user learning history and completion data
- `/user/learningplan-service/v1`: Provides access to user learning plans
- `/user/userlearning-service/v1`: Offers detailed user learning information

### Course and Certification Data
- `/user/curriculum/v1`: Access to curriculum data
- `/user/learningEvent/v1`: Information about learning events
- `/admin/learningEvent/v1`: Administrative access to learning events
- `/user/itemAssignment/v1`: Details about item assignments to users

## Key Endpoints for Employee Organizational Data

### User and Organization Structure
- `/admin/user-service/v1` and `/admin/user-service/v2`: Administrative access to user data
- `/user/user-service/v1` and `/user/user-service/v2`: User-level access to user data
- `/admin/searchStudent/v1`: Search functionality for finding users

### Hierarchical and Role Data
- User services include access to organizational hierarchy, roles, and manager relationships
- Employee demographic data is accessible through user service endpoints

## Data Extraction and ETL Considerations

### Rate Limiting and Throttling
- API has throttling limits as documented in section 4 of the API documentation
- Pagination is required for handling large data sets (section 5.2 of documentation)

### Data Formats and Schemas
- API returns data in JSON format
- Detailed field definitions are available for each endpoint
- Credit hours, completion status, and other learning metrics are available

## Best Practices for Integration

### Error Handling
- API returns standard HTTP error codes
- Detailed error messages are provided in the response body

### Security Considerations
- All API calls must be made over HTTPS
- Proper token management is essential
- Administrator permissions are required for certain endpoints
